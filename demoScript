Doctor: Hello Mr. George, how are you today?
Patient: Hello Doctor, I feel a lot more tired than usual and I've been unintentionally losing a lot of weight- I'm a lot skinnier now.
Doctor: Oh I see, let's get to the bottom of this. Are you experiencing any of the following: frequent urination, blurred vision, or poor wound healing?
Patient: Hm, I think I have been experiencing frequent urination and blurred vision.
Doctor: It seems like you have Type 2 Diabetes. I am going to prescribe you metformin. Are you on any other medication?
Patient: No I am not. **_checks off Not On Other Medication_**
Doctor: Okay. Have you ever had an infection in your liver or kidneys?
Patient: No, I have not had any. **_checks off Must Not Have Liver Disease or Kidney Disease_**
Doctor: Perfect. Are you allergic to any medication?
Patient: No. **_checks off Must Not Be Allergic to Metformin_**

Script #2:
Doctor: Hello Mr. George, how are you today?
Patient: Hello Doctor, I've been experiencing many headaches, dizziness, and chest pain. I am not sure why.
Doctor: Oh I see, let's get to the bottom of this. Are you experiencing nausea, anxiety, or difficulty breathing?
Patient: Yes, I have!
Doctor: It seems like you have high blood pressure. I am going to prescribe Hygroton. Have you ever had conditions with your kidney or liver?
Patient: No, I have not.
Doctor: Do you drive often?
Patient: No, I use public transportation everywhere.
Doctor: Okay good. Limit any driving or activity that requires alertness until you can do so safely with the drug. Do you go outdoors often?
Patient: Yes, I go outside all the time.
Doctor: Okay, I have to warn you- hygroton makes your skin sensitive, so you should limit your exposure to the sun. You should use sunscreen and wear protective clothing when going outdoors.
Patient: Okay. I also think my skin is abnormally sensitive. I get very itchy when I spend a lot of time in the sun already. Do you have any medication for that?
Doctor: Yes! I can prescribe you some Benadryl. 
Doctor: For hygroton, make sure to drink plenty of water and since you have diabetes, check your blood pressure regularly when you start taking hygroton.
Patient: Okay.
Doctor: For Benadryl, make sure you do not have any breathing and urinary issues before use.
Patient: I do not have any.
Doctor: When on Benadryl, please avoid alcohol, sedatives, or tranquilizers.
Patient: Sounds good.
Doctor: Also, like before, do not do anything that requires alertness. Keep in mind that the drug can result in drowsiness.
Patient: Okay, I will keep that in mind! Thank you!
